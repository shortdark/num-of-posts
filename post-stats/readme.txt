This is a simple plugin to look at the volume of posts per year and the volume of posts in each
category. It obviously works better the more posts you have over the longer period, and if you
use categories.

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/post-stats` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

3. The menu item "Post Stats" should now be in your admin menu. Click and check out your "Post Stats"!
