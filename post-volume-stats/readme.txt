Shows stats for the volume of posts per year, category, tag, day-of-the-week and hour-of-the-day.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin to look at the volume of posts per year and the volume of posts in each
category and tag. It works best if you have posts over multiple years, and if you use categories and tags.
It also shows the hours of the day and day of the week posts are made on.
