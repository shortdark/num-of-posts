# post-stats
My first Wordpress plugin. I originally based it on the one file plugin, Hello Dolly. I modified the simple plugin to count the number of posts per year, and get the number of posts per category. Initially the plugin just put all this info in a comment beneath the post content on a single Wordpress post. Then, it was adapted to be an admin plugin (back to Dolly), but instead of being an admin notice, as Dolly is, it has it's own page and displays the info there.

Currently there is a graphical representation of year, category, tag, day-of-the-week and hour-of-the-day stats, with more to come.
